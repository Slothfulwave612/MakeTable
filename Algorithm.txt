Algorithm (Making Table)

1. Ask for total number of columns as input 'colTotal', which will be an integer value.

2. Make two empty lists, 'colList' and 'rowList', 'colList' will store the name of columns and 'rowList' will store all the information about the column names.

3. Ask for total number of rows as input 'rowTotal', which will be an integer value.

4. Run a loop 'colTotal' number of time.
		4.1. Ask for the name of column as 'x', which will be a string value.
		4.2. Then append the value of 'x' in the list 'colList'.

5. Run a loop 'rowTotal' number of time.
		5.1. Run a nested loop 'colTotal' number of time.
		5.2. Ask forthe description of each column as input 'x', which will be a string value.
		5.3. Then append the value of 'x' in list 'rowList'.

6. Assign value zero to a variable 'c'.

7. Make an empty list 'maxLength', which will store the maximum length of either information in a row or column name(of the particular column), whichever found big.
		7.1. Run a loop 'colTotal' number of times as i.
				7.1.1. Assign length of 'colList' element to a variable 'temp'
				7.1.2. Run a nested loop, from c to length of 'rowList' number of times and giving step value equal to length of 'colList' as j.
						7.1.2.1 If the length of 'colList' element is greater than the value of 'temp', then length of 'colList' element will become 'temp'.
				7.1.3. Append 'temp' value to 'maxLength' list.
				7.1.4. Increment the value of 'c' by 1.

8. Assign value zero to variables 'dashes' and 'c'.

9. Traverse the list 'colList' as i.
		9.1. Add length of '| ', i(element of colList), ' ' * (maxLength[c] - length of i), ' |' to 'dashes'.
		9.2. Print the column name in the required format as:
			 '| ' + i + ' ' * (maxLength[c] - length of i) + ' |'
		9.3. Increment the length of 'c' by 1.

10. Print '=' * dashes.

11. Assign the value zero to variable 'c'.

12. Traverse through the list 'rowList' as i.
		12.1. Print '| ', i, ' ' * (maxLength[c] - len(i)), ' |'
		12.2. Increment the value of 'c' by 1.
		12.3. If the value of 'c' is equal to the length of 'colList', then assign the value of 'c' is equal to zero, go to another line.
